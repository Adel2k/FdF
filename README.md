## Overview

The FdF project aims to create a wireframe representation of a 3D map provided in a file. The program reads the file, parses the data to create a 3D map, and then projects it onto a 2D plane for visualization. The project tests your understanding of C programming, data structures, algorithms, and basic graphical programming.

## Features

- **3D Map Parsing:** Read a 3D map from a file and parse the data.
- **2D Projection:** Project the 3D map onto a 2D plane using a chosen projection method.
- **Wireframe Visualization:** Display the 3D map using a wireframe representation.
- **Interactive Controls:** Implement keyboard and mouse controls for interacting with the visualization.
- **Dynamic Color:** Apply color schemes based on height or other map properties.

## Requirements

- **C Compiler:** Ensure you have a C compiler, such as `gcc` or `clang`, available.
- **Graphics Library:** The project typically uses a graphics library like MiniLibX, so ensure you have it installed and configured.
- **Operating System:** The project is primarily intended for Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux or macOS.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adel2k/FdF.git
   cd fdf

## Usage

- For zoom in and zoom out use plus/minus keys in keypad.
- For increase or decrease the depth use 'w' ans 's'.
- For translate use right\left\up and down keys.
- For rotation press and hold '2' and '3' keys.
- For top view use '1'.
- For exit use 'ESC'.
- For first view use 'space'.
